# Xircus Hackathon - Serious.job

## Inspiration
The current freelance marketplace (Upwork, Fiverr, etc.) are flooded by scams, fraud jobs, spams and identity harvesters. Discrimination among some races also affect their hiring rate and offers. And lastly, freelancers are less protected by the law and corporate policies.


## What it does

#### Anonymizing Freelancers' Identity
To prevent, if not completely eradicate the biases, discrimination, and low-balling in hiring talents

#### Build Trust using Blockchain 
Freelancers can use blockchain to verify their identity and showcase their skills and experience to potential clients. Clients, in turn, can use blockchain to verify the credentials and reputation of freelancers before hiring them.

#### Setup Smart Contracts
To protect both the employer and the freelancer, ensuring payments are made every time a task or milestone is completed, without a huge cut from traditional freelance platform.
